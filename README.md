# SimpleMapper

TODO update this readme

## TODO write the functionality which has been added
- defining line (with following the new point)

## TODO ideas how to improve the tool:

- think of the name of this tool
- preset
- fill background between lines
- validations for almost everything
- move whole line
- select and modify (extend/remove point) existing line
- add possibility of adding a text
- right click on the canvas -> some available actions
- CTRL + Z
- shortcuts
- better styling
- migrate to Angular/TypeScript/Node/Vue/React - whatever
- do a nice side(?) menu with all options: select, edit, remove, etc
- flexible width/height of the canvas
- nicer buttons for download and upload
- possible to draw straight lines (prox calculation for the X or Y)
- able to change line to be polygon
- save polygon type in the data
- provide a demo object
- pressing mouse -> creating rect
- think if any additional attributes should be attached to the data

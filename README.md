- context menu for stage https://konvajs.org/docs/sandbox/Canvas_Context_Menu.html
- modify (remove point) existing line (maybe with using context menu even without selecting the shape?)
- adding text (by context menu): https://konvajs.org/docs/shapes/Text.html
- able to change line to be polygon
- able to change polygon to be line
- save polygon type in the data
